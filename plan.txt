plan
iteration 1: static engine
- build in pre-defined order (including patching in order)
- predict if the opponent attack based on mobile score -> patch
- send units in 3 batches, ideally 6 - 4 - 4
iteration 2: predict on defense & evolve
- find all possible paths that opponent scouts can take
- build turret at weak points
- predict that opponent is planning attack by wall deletion
- plan resources & build support only on first turn of attack
- remove weak walls?
iteration 3: pathing & predict on offense
- create pathing that minimises interaction with enemy turrets
- predict if sending troops will guarantee scoring (calculate with buffer)
  -> only send if can score with high guarantee
